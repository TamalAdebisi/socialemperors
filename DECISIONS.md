# Judgment calls

Calls made on the owner's behalf while building, newest first, so any of
them can be found and reversed. The big, agreed decisions are in
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md#decisions-so-far).

## Waiting on the owner

- **The new client's menu layout.** Option 1, classic corners (buttons in
  the corners, a neighbours drawer along the bottom, the World button's
  pop-up), is the favourite of both of us over option 3 (a rail and a
  dock). It becomes the first slice of Beta 1 once the owner says so.

## 14 October 2026: tidying up, ground rules, browser tests

- **Removed what the fork left behind:** the Windows bundle's build scripts
  (`build/`, the PyInstaller part of `bundle.py`), two Flash Player
  installers (42 MB, `distr/`; FLASH.md links Adobe's archive instead), the
  old releases and Linux pages (their Linux steps are now in FLASH.md), two
  game settings files for other versions of the game that nothing read, a
  script for making settings patches whose input file was gone, and two
  pictures no page used. All of it is still in git's history.
- **Kept:** `mods/` (the server can still apply a mod to everyone's game;
  none is switched on), the built-in neighbours in `villages/`, and the
  import of single-player saves.
- **`bundle.py` is now `paths.py`:** it only says where the server's
  folders are, now that there's no bundle.
- **README:** rewritten for socialemperors.me. The original project's
  download and Discord badges went (they point at its releases and its
  community, not ours); it's credited instead, with the GPL's note that
  the code has been changed.
- **Browser tests:** each test player says it's a different visitor through
  a header that only the test server listens to, so the limit on new
  accounts doesn't block a run.
- **Home page:** the new client's description now says you can build and
  run your town in it, not just look.

## October 2026: the new client's look

- **Food is a carrot** (the owner asked for something vegetarian), drawn in
  the game's style, without a face. To undo: add `"food": ("IconResourcesMC", 2)`
  to `tools/art/export_ui.py` and remove `client/src/ui/art/food.svg`.
- **Icon files** are at most 160 pixels on their longest side, as WebP at
  quality 90: 220 KB for all of them instead of 552 KB, with no visible
  difference at the sizes they're shown.

## October 2026: shop, storage and editing

- **Cutting trees and mining rocks** stay in the classic game until units
  walk in the new client; selecting a tree says so.
- **Messages at the top** queue up, at most three waiting, each shown for
  2.5 seconds, so a quick run of taps doesn't flood the screen.
- **"Remove" instead of "Sell"** on anything that gives nothing back.
- **The shop's pictures** are the Flash client's own; when one is missing,
  the client draws the building itself instead.
